QuickUI is a tool to instantly create a usable UI from any python file which uses Argument Parser.  
 
With it, you know exactly what parameters need to be passed to the program while running it and what default parameters will the file accept. 
It also provides an easy way to track the previous runs of your process.  

Since, it creates a web interface,
you can easily "ngrok" it for a while and ask someone who understands the code to run it for you by specifying all parameters easily.
